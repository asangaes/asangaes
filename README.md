### Asanga Edirisinghe # EDI

<!--
**asangaes/asangaes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Let me introduce myself: my name is Edi, and I'm a full-stack developer and instructional designer working on online solutions to meet the demands of many stakeholders. I do analysis, design, coding, and implementation in my area. Most of the projects are created from scratch throughout the lifecycle of a project, beginning with conceptualization and ending with the solution of real-world problems through the application of code. Any video starts with an idea, moves through careful planning, and ends with a flourish of artistic genius.

**`Full-Stake Developer, Instructor, Instructional Designer and System Analyst`**

To put it simply, I'm Edi, and qualified professional in the information technology and educational sectors. I am an experienced learning designer with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry and over ten years of solid experience in educational technology and learning design. Also, I began my professional life working as a multimedia designer, full stack developer, system analyst, and head of the department in a post-secondary institution focused on cutting-edge technology just before moving to Canada. I firmly believe that professional knowledge originates from external sources and the inner reflection of one‚Äôs experience in a particular field.. Here are some recent my published instructional video content on my YouTube channel "[idea-canada][youtube]".

As an instructional designer, I have experience developing effective assessment tools that measure learners' progress and knowledge acquisition. This includes designing formative and summative assessments that align with the learning objectives and provide learners with opportunities to demonstrate their mastery of the content.
I am skilled in developing a range of assessment types, including quizzes, exams, case studies, simulations, and performance assessments. I am also experienced in using learning analytics tools to analyze learners' performance data and identify areas for improvement.
Through my assessment development skills, I can create fair and accurate assessments that provide valuable feedback to learners and inform instructional design decisions, ultimately contributing to improved learning outcomes.
<li><h4>Above average communication</h4></li>
I possess above-average communication skills that enable me to effectively convey instructional content to learners, team members, and stakeholders. I am skilled in both written and verbal communication and can adapt my communication style to the needs of different audiences.
In addition, I am a good listener, which allows me to understand learners' needs, concerns, and feedback, and adjust my instructional materials accordingly. I am also adept at providing constructive feedback and facilitating productive discussions to resolve issues and improve learning outcomes.
Through my strong communication skills, I can foster positive relationships with learners, team members, and stakeholders, ultimately contributing to a successful instructional design project.
<li><h4>Proactive career growth</h4></li>
I am committed to proactive career growth, which involves seeking out opportunities to develop my skills, expand my knowledge, and advance my career. This includes pursuing professional development opportunities such as attending conferences, workshops, and webinars, and participating in professional organizations and networking events.
